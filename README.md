# Armstrong Number Checker (C)

This is a simple C program that checks whether a given **three-digit number** is an Armstrong number or not.

### 🧾 How It Works

1. The user enters a three-digit number.
2. The program extracts each digit using arithmetic operations.
3. It calculates the cube of each digit.
4. Then it adds the cubes and compares them with the original number.
5. If they match, it prints that it's an Armstrong number.

### 🔧 Requirements
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- math.h library (standard with most C environments)
